			<h1> About Me</h1>
			<p>	My Name is Mandeep Heer. I am 23 years old and have lived in Birmingham all my life. I grew up in a family of 6 consisting of my parents and 3 sisters (me being the only son yikes!). When growing up i was always told that I was very easily distracted, loved to explore and I absolutely loved playing sports and was always super competitive, I hate losing till today! So yeah, this is my first time creating a website and i'm hoping I could give it a decent effort!
