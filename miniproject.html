			<h1> About Me</h1>
			<p>	My Name is Mandeep Heer. I am 23 years old and have lived in Birmingham all my life. I grew up in a family of 6 consisting of my parents and 3 sisters (me being the only son yikes!). When growing up i was always told that I was very easily distracted, loved to explore and I absolutely loved playing sports and was always super competitive, I hate losing till today! So yeah, this is my first time creating a website and i'm hoping I could give it a decent effort!</p>

			<h1> Career</h1>
			<p> I started working as soon as I left school! I had many different interests in my life at the time so I needed to fund my hobbies so that I could ease my parents expenditure! As soon as I turned 16 I took a job where I was waitering at many different venues around the country, i didn't really enjoy this job as I was earning money but was left with no time to actually enjoy my life! I then decided to work hard for a couple months to raise some money and then quit! After that I took up a part time job at primark whilst I was at university to give myself Disposable income and money to travel after studying and now I am early into my career beginning as a software tester with Sparta Global.

		<section id="hobbies">
			<h1> Hobbies </h1>
			<p>Throughout my life, I have had many different hobbies that me myself couldn't keep up with them! Throughout my life I took up playing many different sports ranging from football to less frequently played sports of American football and mountain biking. Alongside my interests in sports I had a massive interest in the big wide world and started to drawer up a big bucket list of places that I wish to visit within my lifetime! I've not eveen halfway into my list yet and I'm always adding new places rather than reducing the list!</p>
